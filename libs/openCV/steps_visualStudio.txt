steps cv addon - 

(note there are images in the steps_images folder to accompany this)

-------------------------------------------------------------

a) add opencv folder to the libs folder

b) add computerVision into the libs/openframeworks folder

now, let's add the contents of the computerVision folder to your project

c) add a new folder in openframeworks folder for the cv code
(in v.s. this is called a "filter", but it looks like a folder to me)

d) name the folder/filter computerVision

e) right click the folder -> add existing item

f) navigate to the computer vision folder you added in step (b)
and add all the files

now, let's add a ton of includes/links

for the first part (includes) we will alter both debug and release at the same time

g) right click the properties of the project

h) for the first part (includes) we will alter both configurations (debug and release), this is how you set that

i,j) in c++ > general > additonal include diretories, we will add:

..\..\libs\openFrameworks\computerVision
..\..\libs\opencv\cv\include
..\..\libs\opencv\cxcore\include

k) now, we add these link include paths, at
linker > general > additional library directories:
add this one:
..\..\libs\opencv\lib

**** now, for the next step, we will do this individually, for debug and release ****
(see step h, choose debug, and then release -
note: the reason for this is the OF debug links to a debug version of 
rtAudio, and the release version links to a release version of that 
lib, so the lists of actaul libs are different between releases)

!!!! please be careful with this step, because if you alter them for both configurations
you can clober all libs that are linked very easily, and you will have alot of trouble!!!
do it for debug and then release and you should be fine!

add to that list:
cv.lib
cxcore.lib

l) now replace the source code for the project with the src provided here

m) now you will need to add the dlls in the dll folder 
to the both the Debug and Release folders in the project (where the exe is compiled to):

cv097.dll
cxcore097.dll
